# Getting Started in APCS

To get started in APCS you'll need to set up a few tools and get comfortable with them.

### Git and Github

1. Get a free github account here: https://www.github.com
   * Pick a username that you're okay to use as a nickname in this class. It could be your school username or it could be another one. Just be clean and respectful.

2. Get one sheet of blank paper and label it "notes for gh-cheatsheet".

3. Watch the video called _What is Github?_ by clicking the image here:

4. On your cheatsheet notes, write a sentence or two that describes your current understanding of what github is.

5. Prepare yourself to watch the full Shiffman playlist "Git and Github for Poets" by clicking the image below, and do these things while you're watching:

   * During each video, follow along in your own github account. Meaning: make your own poem (different from Shiffman's) and do what he does. Pause the video when you have to. If you get stuck, get help before you move on. 
   * At the end of each video, add to your cheatsheet notes any commands or buttons that you think will be useful to remember in the future. Be sure to include at least ___ ___ ___ ___ .
   * You don't have to do anything during the last video in the series (9.10 Github Page for Hosting p5.js Sketches). However this is still a helpful video to watch because in future assignments you will do some similar things.

6. Compare your cheatsheet notes with your partner's. Get a new sheet of blank paper, and together with your partner consolidate your notes into one cheatsheet. Title it as "gh-cheatsheet" and make sure it looks clean and organized.
